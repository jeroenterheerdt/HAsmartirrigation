"""The shipped blueprints have to be importable and actually wired up.

Blueprints are the bridge between the calculation and whatever runs the valves,
so they are the first thing a new user touches. They are also YAML that nothing
executes in CI, which is how four of them shipped broken at once:

- two Irrigation Unlimited ones passed a variable to ``states()`` quoted, so it
  looked up an entity literally named "duration"; the condition never passed;
- the weather one referenced five of its own inputs as bare Jinja names, which
  Home Assistant does not resolve, so the temperature and wind checks compared
  against 0 and the seasonal multiplier was empty;
- one asked for a ``switch`` for Irrigation Unlimited, which exposes
  ``binary_sensor``, and then called ``switch.turn_on`` on it.

These check the properties that would have caught all of that.
