"""The skip conditions report why they veto, not just that they do (#794).

A panel that only knows a run was skipped cannot tell anyone why, which is what
people ask. So the checks report themselves and the boolean falls out of them:
the explanation is produced by the code that makes the decision, so the two
cannot disagree.
