"""The crop factor scales the crop's water use, not the rain (#779).

The zone multiplier is documented as the crop factor Kc, and it used to be
applied at the very end to the duration. That scaled the whole water balance
rather than the evapotranspiration, with two consequences Megalos worked out:

- the rain was scaled with it, so only Kc times the millimetres that fell were
  credited, and a Kc below 1 therefore over-watered;
- the bucket kept draining at the full ET0, so any threshold to irrigate at was
  reached about 1/Kc times too fast, and a factor applied afterwards cannot undo
  a decision about *when* to water.

ETc = ET0 * Kc, applied before the bucket is depleted.
