"""The write endpoints have to accept every field their model is made of.

The panel reads an object and posts the whole thing back when any single field
is edited. Voluptuous rejects unknown keys, so a field added to a model without
being added to that endpoint's schema fails the entire save with a 400, whatever
the user was actually editing.

That is how v2026.8.3 shipped with `precipitation_superseded` breaking every
zone save from the panel (#813, #812). This compares the two lists so the next
field cannot do it again, for zones and for sensor groups alike.
