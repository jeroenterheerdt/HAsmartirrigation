"""Observed-watering bucket crediting (closed-loop, opt-in).

When enabled, the coordinator watches each zone's linked valve/switch entity and
credits that zone's bucket whenever the valve runs. The applied depth is either:

* measured, when the zone also has a cumulative flow/volume meter (a water-meter
  style ``total_increasing`` sensor): volume = meter_at_close - meter_at_open,
  depth_mm = volume_L / size_m2 -- the most accurate path (#626); or
* estimated, otherwise, from the run time and the zone's configured throughput
  (volume = minutes x throughput; depth_mm = volume_L / size_m2).

This closes Smart Irrigation's open loop: the soil-moisture bucket is replenished
from real irrigation (a scheduled run, a manual tap, or any automation that opens
the valve) instead of from a separate manual reset.

When direct valve control is also enabled, runs driven by Smart Irrigation itself
are suppressed here (via the per-zone ``_si_driven_until`` marker) so the bucket
is never credited twice -- the runner credits those directly. Every other observed
run (manual tap, external automation) is real watering worth crediting.
The flip side: when this feature is on it MUST be the only thing crediting the
bucket for external runs. If an irrigation automation still calls the
``reset_bucket`` service after watering, remove that call, or the bucket is
accounted twice.

The methods live on a mixin the SmartIrrigationCoordinator inherits, so they use
``self`` to reach coordinator state (store, hass, the observer subscription).
