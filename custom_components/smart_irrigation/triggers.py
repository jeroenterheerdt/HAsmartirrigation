        The bucket itself is deliberately left alone. It is a running balance:
        irrigation credits it by the water actually applied, and the next
        calculation adds the whole interval's rain, so crediting the rain here as
        well would count it twice. Shortening only this run keeps the balance
        exact, since the smaller amount applied is what gets credited.

        A zone whose sensor group saw no rain is not touched at all, so a dry
