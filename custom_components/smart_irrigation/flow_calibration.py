"""Tell the user when their configured throughput does not match reality.

Every duration Smart Irrigation computes goes through the zone's throughput:
the bucket says how many mm are missing, the size turns that into litres, and
the throughput turns litres into minutes. A throughput taken off a sprinkler
datasheet rather than measured at the tap is one of the quietest ways to water
twice as long as intended, or half as long, forever.

A zone that has a flow meter already gives us the answer for free: the observed
run knows both how many litres came out and how long the valve was open. This
module turns those two numbers into a measured throughput, smooths it over
several runs so one odd run cannot swing it, and raises a repair issue when it
drifts away from what the user configured.

Advisory only, deliberately. We never write the measured value into the zone's
throughput: pressure varies, a meter can be plumbed upstream of more than one
zone, and silently changing how long valves stay open is not a thing to do
behind somebody's back. We say what we measured and let them decide.

The methods live on a mixin the SmartIrrigationCoordinator inherits.

Credit: measuring real flow to sanity-check the configured value is an idea
from JustChr's Smart Irrigation fork (https://github.com/JustChr/
HAsmartirrigation), MIT.
