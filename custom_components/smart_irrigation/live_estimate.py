"""Where a zone stands right now, between two calculations.

The bucket a zone reports is the one its last calculation committed, typically
in the small hours. By the time anybody opens the panel it can be most of a day
old, so the number on screen describes last night rather than this afternoon.

This runs the same calculation over the readings collected since then and does
not commit the result. That is the whole design: the estimate is a partial
evaluation of the function that will later produce the real value, so it lands
on that value rather than drifting away from it and having to be reconciled.
Nothing here writes to the store, fires an event or touches a valve.

Two limits worth knowing, both stated rather than hidden:

* A zone whose module uses forecasting is estimated without the forecast. The
  forecast costs a weather-service call, and a display refresh must not spend
  one every time somebody opens a tab.
* An estimate is only as good as the readings so far. Early in an interval it
  rests on very little, which is exactly when it is furthest from the value the
  calculation will commit.
