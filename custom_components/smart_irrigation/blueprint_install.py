"""Install the blueprints we bundle into the user's own blueprint folders.

Home Assistant has no API for "this integration ships blueprints", so we copy
the YAML files next to this module into ``config/blueprints/<domain>/
smart_irrigation/`` when the integration starts. Users get working examples for
their hardware without hunting through the documentation first.

The copy is skipped whenever a file of that name is already there, so a
blueprint somebody has imported or edited by hand is never overwritten. The
flip side is that an improved blueprint reaches existing users through the
import link in the docs rather than silently behind their back, which is the
trade we want for something that opens valves.

Every filesystem error is logged and swallowed: failing to lay down an example
automation must never stop the integration from setting up.
