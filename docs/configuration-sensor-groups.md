Sensor groups define what sources provide the weather data to be collected and calculated on to determine irrigation duration. You can use any numeric Home Assistant sensor, regardless of its source. Additionally, if you [configured a weather service](installation-weatherservice.md) in this integration, you can retrieve the data from that as well.

## Adding a sensor group
Enter a sensor group name and select `Add sensor groups`. Your sensor group is added and you 'wire up' the sensors.

## Configuring a sensor group
Apart from changing the name, you can specify the source where to retrieve the weather data metrics. Metrics can be retrieved from a weather service (assuming you set it up), a sensor or a static value. When using a sensor or static value as a source, take care to make sure the unit the integration expects is the same as your sensor provides. You can choose which aggregation to use like average, maximum, minimum etc.

It's recommended to use actual sensor sources as much as you can and only rely on weather services as needed. If your zone is covered (such as a green house), of course you can set the total precipitation to 0.

The following data can be provided:

| Data | Required | Available sources | Available units | Expected aggregation | Expected aggregation for continuous updates |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|
|**Current precipitation**|No|Weather Service<br/>Sensor<br/>Static value|in/h<br/>mm/h|Average|Riemann Sum|
|**Dewpoint**|Yes|Weather Service<br/>Sensor<br/>Static value|°C<br/>°F|Average|Last|
|**Evapotranspiration**|No|None (module will calculate it)<br/>Sensor<br/>Static value|in<br/>mm|Average|Last|
|**Humidity**|Yes|Weather Service<br/>Sensor<br/>Static value|%|Average|Last|
|**Total precipitation**|No|Sensor<br/>Static value|in<br/>mm|Delta|Delta|
|**Pressure** (*see notes below the table)|Yes|Weather Service<br/>Sensor<br/>Static value|hPa<br/>inch Hg<br/>millibar<br/>psi|Average|Last|
|**Solar Radiation**|No|None (requires module to estimate it)<br/>Sensor<br/>Light sensor (lux)<br/>Static value|MJ/day/m2<br/>MJ/day/sq ft<br/>W/m2<br/>W/sq ft|Average|Riemann Sum|
|**Temperature**|Yes|Weather Service<br/>Sensor<br/>Static value|°C<br/>°F|Average|Last|
|**Wind speed**|Yes|Weather Service<br/>Sensor<br/>Static value|meter/s<br/>mile/h<br/>km/h<br/>knot|Average|Last|

Please note:
- If you use a [weather service](installation-weatherservice.md), make sure your home zone coordinates are set correctly so the data is correct. This is especially true if you set the coordinates manually in the configuration.yaml.
- Pressure can either be absolute or relative pressure: _absolute barometric pressure_ is the actual pressure measured at your location, while _relative barometric pressure_ is the pressure calculated at sea level. Check the source of your data to find out whether it provides absolute or relative pressure.
- Humidity for your sensor group is the air humidity / atmospheric humidity, _not_ soil humidity. Soil Humidity sensors do not provide useful information for this integration and cannot be used.
- **Greenhouse.** A sensor group has a greenhouse switch, for an enclosed environment: a greenhouse, a polytunnel, anything under glass or plastic. Turning it on takes precipitation out of the water balance for every zone using that group, and hides its two rain fields, because rain measured outside waters nothing inside. Two things it does not decide for you, since neither can be guessed from the switch: give **Wind speed** a static value near 0, because the FAO-56 aerodynamic term assumes open air, and give **Solar Radiation** a light sensor, as below.

  The **weather-based irrigation skip** and its threshold are still settings for the whole installation rather than per sensor group, but a forecast of rain no longer pauses your greenhouse. A rain forecast is a statement about the sky, so when it would skip the run, zones in a greenhouse group go ahead and only the zones the rain can actually reach are held back for that run. Their deficit is untouched and rolls over to the next one, exactly as a skipped day would have left it. If nothing in your installation is under glass, nothing changes: the run is skipped as before, and no start event fires.
- **Greenhouses: a light sensor can stand in for a solar radiation sensor.** Under glass or plastic there is no usable sky, so a weather service has nothing relevant to say and the calculation loses the term that drives it. Most greenhouses have no pyranometer, but a light sensor is cheap and common. Set Solar Radiation's source to **Light sensor (lux)**, pick your illuminance entity, and the reading is converted to W/m2 and fed to the same Penman-Monteith calculation a real radiation sensor would feed.

  The conversion divides lux by the **luminous efficacy** of daylight, which the panel exposes and defaults to 110 lm/W. Daylight sits between roughly 93 and 120 lm/W and glazing shifts the spectrum, so that is the number to calibrate if you can compare against an independent radiation figure: raise it and the estimated radiation falls. As a sanity check, full daylight of about 100 000 lux comes out near 900 W/m2.

  Two other things to set for a greenhouse, which the integration does not infer for you: put Wind speed on a **static value** near 0, since the FAO-56 aerodynamic term assumes open air, and leave precipitation unmapped or static at 0, since it does not rain indoors.

  If you would rather not use this, a template sensor dividing your lux entity by 110 and reported as `W/m2` reaches the same result through the ordinary Sensor source.
- Wind speed needs to be measured at 2 meters height. If you are using Open Weather Map this is automatically done for you, but if you do not, you need to make sure the input sensor returns the wind speed at the correct height. You can use a template sensor like the following for this:
   ```yaml
   sensor:
     - platform: template
       sensors:
         wind_at_2m:
           friendly_name: Wind Speed at 2m
           value_template: {% raw %}"{{states('[name of your wind speed sensor (WSmeasured)]')|float()*(4.87/log((67.8*[height the wind speed was measured on in meters (H)])-5.42))}}"{% endraw %}
   ```
- Total precipitation is the total amount of precipitation you want to take into account for the calculations. Use the 'Delta' aggregation type along with a sensor source that accumulates over a time period, usually named something like 'daily rain', 'weekly rain', or 'total rain'. The delta aggregation will correctly handle value resets (such as daily rain becoming zero at midnight). Keep in mind that the total precipitation is expected to be a total over the time period, not the current precipitation rate.
- Current precipitation is a *rate* (mm/h or in/h), while total precipitation is a *depth* (mm or in) accumulated over the interval. They are two different quantities and only one of them feeds the water balance: total precipitation is used when it has a value, and current precipitation is only used when it does not. That way a rain rate sensor is never counted on top of a rain gauge.
- **A weather service supplies the rate, not the total.** All three services report the rain of the last hour (or, for Pirate Weather, the rate at this instant), which is a measurement. Their daily precipitation figure is a *forecast* for the part of the day that has not happened yet, so crediting it to the bucket would add rain that may never fall. The rate is collected at every update and integrated over the interval since the last calculation to give the amount of rain that actually fell. If you use a weather service, leave total precipitation unset and let current precipitation come from the service.
- **Set the automatic update interval to 1 hour or shorter when precipitation comes from a weather service.** The services report the last hour only, so collecting every few hours leaves the hours in between unobserved and rain falling in them is not counted. Only the hours actually observed are credited, so a coarse interval under-reports rain rather than scaling up what it happened to see. A warning is logged if the interval is longer than an hour.
- Map total precipitation when you have a rain gauge of your own that accumulates, which is more accurate than any service. It then takes precedence over the service's rate, so the two are never added together.
- With the 'Average' aggregation on current precipitation the mean rate over the interval is used, which is right for evenly spaced samples; with 'Riemann Sum' the samples are integrated over their own timestamps, which is more accurate when they are not evenly spaced.
- When using continuous updates, all aggregations are expected to be set to `Last`, with the exception of Solar Radiation and Current Precipitation, which need to be set to `Riemann Sum`, and Total Precipitation, which needs `Delta`.
